									 WSaaS
					   Web Server as a Service over CCNX
===============================================================================

On all nodes, except client nodes, these should be running:
 - ccnd 
 - olsrd with ccninfo plug-in
 - rbnagent.sh
For details please refer to the CORE emulator service file:
../emulation/myservices/ccn_olsrd.py

On nodes hosting websites:
 - start ccnr by just typing:
    ccnr &
 - upload and register the website with the wsaas_boot.sh script. e.g.
    ./scripts/wsaas_boot.sh website_01/
   The website_01 directory contains a wsaas.conf file that specifies the 
   domain name associated to the content and an htdocs/ directory with the 
   actual content

On Internet gateway nodes:
 - announce via CCNinfo that the node can reach external domains:
    wget -q -O - "http://127.0.0.1:2012/reg/add/TestCCN/http"
 - create a caching dir, e.g.
    mkdir /tmp/proxycache
 - go to the ccnx/apps/HttpProxy directory and start NetFetch
    ./NetFetch -fsroot /tmp/proxycache

On proxy nodes:
 - go to the ccnx/apps/HttpProxy directory and start the modified HttpProxy:
    ./HttpProxy -custom ~/HttpProxy.list -resolveHigh
   the HttpProxy.list file should be updated by the rbnagent.sh script, which 
   is assumed to be launched from the home directory

On client nodes:
 - configure a proxy node address, port 8080 as web proxy and try to fetch both
   an internal and external domain.
   For a quick test, wget can be ran directly on the proxy node:
    http_proxy="http://127.0.0.1:8080" wget http://penguins.org/index.html -O -
